                <h2>WHAT IS MARBLE HORNETS?</h2>
                <p>Marble Hornets is a found footage horror web series that originally came out in 2009 on YouTube, created by Troy Wagner.</p>
                <p>The series is presented as an archive of videotapes given to Jay, Troy's character, who investigates the abandoned film project of his friend Alex.</p>
                <p>At first, the series seems to be a typical archive of what Jay and Alex worked on for their film, but it soon spirals into a mystery involving Alex's strange behavior and a "man" who is known as The Operator (the series' interpretation of Slenderman).</p>
                <p>The series consists of 87 parts, including videos from a side channel called "totheark." Its method of storytelling was not only special but also very fun and interesting by including Twitter interactions and other real-world factors such as scavenger hunts for fans to progress the story.</p>
                <p>Marble Hornets was the first "reality series" to include Slenderman and it created offshoots of other web series such as EverymanHYBRID and DarkHarvest00.</p>

                <h2>HOW I FOUND MARBLE HORNETS</h2>
                <div id="testimonies">
                    <p>The way that I found Marble Hornets was from the original "Slender: The Eight Pages" video game from 2012. From watching videos from popular YouTube creators, such as PewDiePie and Markiplier, that sparked my interest in learning about Slenderman and creepypasta in general. It was then when I found Marble Hornets, but I was too scared to watch it alone by myself. So I found a YouTube channel called Aniril1, who had a short series of "watch-alongs" which Marble Hornets and other SlenderVerse series like DarkHarvest00 and EverymanHYBRID.</p>
                    <p>After a few years, and with Aniril not uploading videos anymore, I decided to watch the entire series by myself and I did not regret it. It gave me a whole new perspective on the series without someone commentating over it and making jokes here and there. To this day, I truly think that Marble Hornets is one of the best found footage horror pieces of media out there and there's no contest.</p>
