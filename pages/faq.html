    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p>Here are some questions I get from people sometimes that I have deemed often enough where it needs to be on this page.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Can I use your website as a template for myself?</h3>
    <p>I mean, I guess so. There's not gonna be much to see, but if you like the layout, then go ahead. <b><u>JUST GIVE CREDIT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!</u></b></p>
    <br>
    <h3>How did you do the CRT effect?</h3>
    <p>It's from <a href="https://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html">this</a> article, but modified a little to my liking.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How did you make your site?</h3>
    <p>With my own two hands, self-deprecation, self-love, and my one(1) creative brain cell working overtime.</p>
    <p>I just used VSCodium and looked at other sites for inspiration.</p>
